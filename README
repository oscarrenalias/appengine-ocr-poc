This is a small proof-of-concept of the new OCR capabilities in the Google App Engine SDK 1.6.1, via the Conversion services: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/conversion/overview.html

The code is a small Scalatra application that receives a file uploaded from the client and using the Conversion service,
 does some OCR on the input.

Please note that it does not work yet.

In order to build and deploy, modify src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml and replace "oscar-ocr" with your
own GAE application id. Then, from SBT run "appengine-deploy" and provide your username and password when requested.
